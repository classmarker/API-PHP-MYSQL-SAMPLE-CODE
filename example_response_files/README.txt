Example json and xml files (matching ClassMarker response formats) 
for local hosting to test your api requests before you have results 
in your ClassMarker accounts.

We recommend using the all_groups_recent_results requests as this 
will give you all recent results for groups or link depending on 
your request, rather then having to request single test results 
separately.

Our example code will add all test results to your data from all 
results requests as well as single test results requests.
